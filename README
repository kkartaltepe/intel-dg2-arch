This is a collection of pkgbuilds for testing out DG2 features that depend on
kernel updates that have not yet made it to drm-tip

It is based on the intel i915 backports available at
https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-i915-backports which is built to work
with specific vendor supported kernels.

I have packaged ubuntu's 22.04 linux 5.17 OEM kernel here as well to provide
the platform for the backports package.

The driver will also attempt to load it's compatible HuC/GuC. Since the HuC may
never be upstreamed to linux-firmware I also provide the intel-gpu-firmware
package.

This driver doesnt support the regular DRM kernel interfaces so you must
compile and install intel's mesa fork. This mesa fork does not work with
upstream drivers either so you must swap back to upstream mesa if you swap back
to upstream kernels.

Then a package for Intel's media-driver VAAPI drivers to test the backported
functionality.

Finally try and build ffmpeg with all of intel's staging patches which contains
support for the av1_vaapi encoder.
