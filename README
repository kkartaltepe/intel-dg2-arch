This is a collection of pkgbuilds for testing out DG2 features that depend on
kernel updates that have not yet made it to drm-tip

It is based on the intel i915 backports available at
https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-i915-backports which is built to work
with specific vendor supported kernels.

I have packaged ubuntu's 22.04 linux 5.17 OEM kernel here as well to provide
the platform for the backports package.

The driver will also attempt to load it's compatible HuC/GuC. Since the HuC may
never be upstreamed to linux-firmware I also provide the intel-gpu-firmware
package.

Finally a package for Intel's media-driver VAAPI drivers to test the backported
functionality.
